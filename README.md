Project 1: SNAKE GAME-
The snake games purpose is to be a fun game to pass the time. To play you would need to use the up, down, left, right arrows
on the keyboard. The goal of the game is to guide the green circle (you) to the red squares (obj) and collect purple circles (score).
If you hit your own body or the borders you lose and your score will be recorded as the high score until you beat it. 

I have python 3.8 and pycharm running to play the game.

Project 2: HANGMAN-
Again, the hangman game is just for fun and this game is just guessing letters in an animals name until you guess the correct animal. You have 5 tries to guess the animal the computer randomly selected from my list. The game will display your animal as a bunch of underscores so you know how long the word is and each time you guess a correct letter it swaps the underscore for the correct letter. After you get all the letters correct you win! If you lose no biggie as it is a silly game. 

I have python 3.8 and pycharm running to play the game.

Project 3: Typing Speed Test-
This typing speed test is pretty simple, the player runs the program and it gives them a sentence they must type and grades them on speed, accuracy, and words per minute based on calculations. It pulls from a text file that I put 40 some sentences into and there is a reset button to continue playing without having to rerun the script everytime. 

In order to run this, you must have pygame package installed or use pygame as your interpreter. I used python 3.8 and pycharm while having the pygame library installed.
