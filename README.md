SNAKE GAME-
The snake games purpose is to be a fun game to pass the time. To play you would need to use the up, down, left, right arrows
on the keyboard. The goal of the game is to guide the green circle (you) to the red squares (obj) and collect purple circles (score).
If you hit your own body or the borders you lose and your score will be recorded as the high score until you beat it. 

I have python 3.8 and pycharm running to play the game. 

HANGMAN-
Again, the hangman game is just for fun and this game is just guessing letters in an animals name until you guess the correct animal. You have 5 tries to guess the animal the computer randomly selected from my list.

I have python 3.8 and pycharm running to play the game.
